Three or more magic letters combined in an acronym have, therefore, the power to either support innovation and fair competition, or drown the EU in its vendor lock-in completely. The terms \"open standards\", \"open platforms\", and Free Software are being used more and more often but does it mean that the EU is \"opening\" up for software freedom for real?

This allows us to adopt classically inconsistent \"dream axioms\" and explore curious alternate mathematical universes. In the talk we'll focus on a wondrous connection to models of computation, both standard ones such as ordinary programming languages and exotic models such as hypercomputation which allow for infinitely many steps in finite time and which push the laws of physics to their limits. The special properties of these alternative universes then depend on the nature of our physical reality.",

With that 'unencrypted' e-mails become the exception not the norm.

I work for Education International, the global federation of education unions and do believe that it is essential to bring experts from IT and education together in order to promote a truly innovative use of technology in education - not driven by profit interests, but by a bigger vision of inclusive and just societies. \nIn this participatory workshop I will provide a brief introduction to what is happening in the global policy sphere to then discuss your ideas and critique. \nAdditionally, we are looking for concrete feedback from critical thinkers in the areas of privacy and copyrights. We are starting with a pilot phase to create a global not-for-profit online network that links already existing teacher networks on a global scale.",
